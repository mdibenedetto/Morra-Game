<< Program Requirements >>

    Develop an application to allow a user to play repeatedly the game “Morra Odds and Evens”
    with a computer.

    1. At the beginning of each game the user will be prompted to choose whether
        he/she would like to be either the “Odds” or the “Even” player.

    2. In each round of the game, the user must decide the number
        of fingers to show (i.e. between 1 and 10).

        2.1 Similarly, in each round of the game the computer will
            randomly pick one number between 1 and 10.

    3. In each round, the game displays the computer’s choice.

    4. After each round the game displays the number of points each player has,
        and whether the user or the computer won the round.

    5. A game finishes when one of the players accumulates 12 points.

    6. At the end of a game, the game displays who the winner is,
        and a history of the numbers of fingers shown by both the
        user and the computer per round.

    7. Once a game has finished the application asks the player
        if he/she would like to play another game.

    8. At the end of all games, display a history of games played.
        The history shows, for each game:

        8.1 the number of rounds won and lost by the human player,
        8.2 and how many even and odd numbers have been chosen by each player,
        8.3 and the extra points received by each player per game.

    All the history elements of the game should be coded using arrays.
